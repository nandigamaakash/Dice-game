# Dice-game
The one who scores 100 first is the winner of the game.

Game can be played in following steps:
1. There are two players player1 and player2.
2. By default player1 will have first chance to roll the dice.
3. If a player rolls the dice to 1 then the temp score earned in that attempt will be zero and chance will be passed to other player.
4. So, if a player wants to record their current score before rolling 1 they can use record and the temp score is added to final score and chance is passed to other player.
5. The one who scores 100 first is the winner of the game.
